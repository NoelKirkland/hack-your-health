## Description

Hack your Health is an application that will help user's take charge of their mental health. The user will create calendars of all the things that they think would improve their mental health (e.g., exercise, meditation, social time, etc...) and enter the times they would like to do those activities. At the end of each day the user will fill out a personal inventory form that rates their mood (e.g., happiness, connectedness, piece of mind, etc...). The app will then compare all of the data and give digestible information on what activities are most beneficial to them. For example, let's say that the user has chosen meditation, yoga, and hiking as their chosen calendars. They add events for each of these calendars to their schedule and at the end of three weeks they have clocked 5 hours of meditation (20 minutes 5x per week for 3 weeks), 4.5 hours of yoga (30 minutes 3x per week for 3 weeks), and 2 hours of hiking (1 hour once a week for three weeks but they had to miss it one week). The user has also been rating daily inventory questions every night. Questions like, "how happy are you feeling today?", "how stressed are you feeling today?", "How is your depression today?". At the end of the three weeks they are left with comprehensive data about how these good things that they have chosen to do for themselves are actually affecting their mood in real time.
